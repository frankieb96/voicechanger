# Development log
Which is basically little more than a rant when I am unable to accomplish
anything.

New project! This is my first, non-uni-related, just-for-fun project :D

My idea is to develop a very simple, real-time voice changer. This should
allow me to understand 
- how to work and process audio signals (DSP course should be useful here)
- how to develop a simple user interface in python, using Qt or Tkinter 

Every projects starts by collecting the necessary information. 
I will do it tomorrow.
